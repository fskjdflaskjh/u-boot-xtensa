	Tensilica Avnet XT-AV110 FPGA Evaluation Board
	==============================================

This board is a Xilinx Virtex-4 MB Development Kit from Avnet configured
with an FPGA bitstream from Tensilica. The combination of the Avnet FPGA
board and Tensilica bitstream is called the XT-AV110 by Tensilica.

The configured XT-AV110 board provides:
- Currently perhaps up to two Xtensa or Diamond processor cores.
- An on-chip-debug (OCD) JTAG interface.
- 128 MB of DDR SDRAM memory which is mappable to ROM space for OCD debugging.
- 16 MB of Flash memory mappable to ROM space.
- A NSC 16550 compatible UART and serial port.
- An OpenCores Wishbone 10/100-base-T ethernet interface.

Please see doc/README-xtensa for information concerning the Xtensa
architecture (of which Diamond cores are instances).


Setting up the Board
--------------------

The serial port defaults to 38000 baud, no parity and 1 stop bit.
A terminal emulator must be set accordingly to see the U-Boot prompt.

The board contains an 8-way DIP switch that controls the boot mapping
and selects from a range of default ethernet MAC addresses.

Boot Mapping (DIP switch 8):

    DIP switch 8 maps the system ROM address space (in which the
    reset vector resides) to either SDRAM (off, 0, down) or Flash
    (on, 1, up).  This mapping is implemented in the FPGA bitstream
    and cannot be disabled by software, therefore DIP switch 8 is no
    available for application use. Note DIP switch 7 is reserved by
    Tensilica for future possible hardware use.

    Mapping to SRAM allows U-Boot to be debugged with an OCD/JTAG
    tool such as the Xtensa OCD Daemon connected via a suppored probe.
    See the tools documentation for supported probes and how to
    connect them.  

    The Flash is always mapped at a device (memory mapped I/O) address
    (the address is board specific and is expressed as CFG_FLASH_BASE).
    The device address is used by U-Boot to program the flash, and may
    be used to specify an application to run or U-Boot image to boot.

Default MAC Address (DIP switches 1-6):

    When the board is first powered on, or after the environment has
    been reinitialized, the ethernet MAC address receives a default
    value whose least significant 6 bits come from DIP switches 1-6.
    The default is 00:50:C2:13:6F:xx where xx ranges from 0..3F
    according to the DIP switches, where "on"==1 and "off"==0, and
    switch 1 is the least-significant bit.

    After initial startup, the MAC address is stored in the U-Boot
    environment variable 'ethaddr'. The user may change this to any
    other address with the "setenv" comamnd. After the environment
    has been saved to Flash by the "saveenv" command, this will be
    used and the DIP switches no longer consulted. DIP swithes 1-6
    may then be used for application purposes.


LX110 doesn't have the Debugging Limitations
--------------------------------------------

The XT-AV110 board 128MB of SRAM that can be mapped
to the system ROM address space for debugging a ROM image under
OCD/JTAG. So there isn't a limit on the size of U-Boot to 
128 KB (0x20000) as there is on the LX60.

The u-boot code can be compiled -O0 without any problems;
for example by editing DBGFLAGS and OPTFLAGS in the config.mk 
at the top level directory.

Flash Problems:
---------------
There appears to be problem saving the hardware protection
bits for the flash. This is being investigated. Note that
enabling DEBUG in the flash code appears to prevent the
saveenv command from saving it's data in the flash. 


Using u-boot to boot Linux
--------------------------

While debugging u-boot you likely should modify $(TOPDIR)/config.mk
with:
	DBGFLAGS= -g
	OPTFLAGS= -O0

Note that -g3 seems to mess up the CPP on the cpu linkerscript.

Once u-boot has been compiled you likely want to:

  1. Copy tools/mkimage ~/bin to make it available to 
     Linux kernel makefiles.

  2. Copy u-boot/u-boot.bin to tftp server so it can be 
     saved in flash.

  3. Build the kernel and copy linux/arch/xtensa/boot/uImage 
     to tftp server so it can be downloaded via tftp with u-boot.

  4. Set up environement variables on u-boot; Ex:
	setenv serverip 192.168.11.78           rtos-lab2       Used by tftp
	setenv ipaddr 192.168.11.95             Piet's LX60
	setenv bootfile u-boot.bin
	setenv bootfile uImage.xtensa-2.6.29-smp.test_mmuhifi_c3
	setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,38400 ip=bootp root=nfs coredump_filter=0x00
	setenv bootdelay 10
	setenv bootcmd tftpboot\; bootm
	setenv autostart yes
	saveenv                          

  5. Try booting linux and once it boots with u-boot it's likely
     a good time to save u-boot in the first two sectors of the
     flash.

	a.  Copy u-boot/u-boot.bin to tftp server so it can be
	    saved in flash.

	b. Copy it to memory via tftpboot cmd.

	c. Turn off protection on sectors to save u-boot
		protect off F8000000 F803FFFF
		... done
        	Un-Protected 2 sectors

	d. cp.b d2000000 F8000000 40000
		Copy to Flash... done

	e. protect on F8000000 F803FFFF
		... done
        	Protected 3 sectors

  6. Now set DIP switch 8 on and power cycle the board.
     u-boot should prompt. Ex:

		U-Boot 2009.08-00060-g3aa8b68-dirty (Sep 16 2009 - 00:46:59)
		
		CPU:    Xtensa test_mmuhifi_c3 at 41.6777 MHz
		Board:  XT-AV110: Avnet board + Xilinx LX200 FPGA + Tensilica bitstream
		SysRAM: 96 MB
		Flash: 16 MB
		In:    serial
		Out:   serial
		Err:   serial
		MAC:
		IP:     192.168.11.95
		Autobooting in 10 seconds, press <SPACE> to stop
